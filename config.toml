  description= """
    I am a highly motivated, very experienced and driven systems architect and developer with a passion
    for technology and everything related to software development.
    Always looking for a challenge that can improve my technical and business knowledge.
    <br><br>
    My experience and technical interest has lead me towards Team Lead/Architect roles.
    I've been mentoring development teams, teaching Test Driven Development and the importance of Continuous
    Integration and Delivery at all the business I've worked with.
    My goal is always to develop systems better and faster, using agile methodologies to improve the teams performance
    in order to build high quality software.
    <br><br>
    My tech-stack of choice  is currently Kubernetes for container orchestration, Go for backend services, RabbitMQ for
    messaging, GraphQL for APIs and Vue or React for frontends.
    <br> <br>
    If you need a senior consultant in the DevOps area don't hesitate to send me a message!
